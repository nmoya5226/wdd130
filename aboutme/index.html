    <h2>Noe Moya Jr.</h2>
    <p>Hello, everyone! My name is Noe and I am currently majoring in Applied Technology at BYU online. I love learning how to play chess, reading scriptures, playing video games, and spending time with my wonderful wife, Emily. We're approaching our two-year anniversary mark and we're very excited about it.
     <p>Right now, I'm working as a Quality Control Associate at Carvana, but hopefully as I finish with this degree, I could earn myself a job doing programming or developing with code. I can already see many advantages with careers in web design as it allows you to become creative with how you want to develop and create websites. I hope that I can learn to take in as much informationas I can, so that I can be prepared for the many programming classes that I'll be taking in the future.</p> I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for around a year and a half now. I have a bunch of favorite scriptures to include, but one of them has to be in chapter 9, verse 62 of Luke which says, "No man, having put his hand to the plough and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God." It just boldly and directly emphasizes the importance of having Jesus Christ as the center of our lives and what we aspire to be. </p>
