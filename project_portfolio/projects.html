            This short Python code is one of my first projects that I am proud to say that I have accomplished. 
            I sometimes remember this program to remind myself how far I have come in my learning of Python.

            This project is basically the Worlde game in Python. It was the most difficult for me, because it reuqired me to think outside the box for a solution.
            I had to do a lot of digging and scouring the internet to find the right components for this code and after hours of searching, I was finally able to complete it up to standards.

            This project is the program that I am currently working on. It is, by far, the most comprehensive program that I have written so far. 
            This program is basically a shopping cart that allows you to add and remove items, attach prices and find their total, and to give you suggestions on what to buy.
            It uses a lot of loops and lists and I am very proud of this project.
