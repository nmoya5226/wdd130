            Why do you have your own project portfolio website?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of this site is to showcase my unique skills, achievements, and personality in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. 
            As a personal portfolio website, my website stands out from others by showcasing a unique blend of creativity and professionalism, while also highlighting my diverse skillset and abilities.

        <h3>
            Who would your audience be for this site?
        </h3>
        <p>
            My personal portfolio website is primarily intended for potential employers, clients, and collaborators who are interested in learning about my professional background, skills, and accomplishments. Additionally, the website may also appeal to individuals in the creative industry, such as fellow designers, artists, or photographers, who are interested in viewing my work and networking.

        <h3>
            What careers or oppurtunities do you hope to pursue?
        </h3>
        <p>
            At the moment, it is my first semester learning about programming languages, so I am still very new to the programming field.
            However, as I am learning about the basic principles of Python, HTML, and CSS, I have found an appreciation for how these languages can imporve our everyday life.
            I hope to pursue any careers and oppurtunities that I feel are a good fit for me, but I do have a fondness for Python as I love learning about how to problem-solve with Python.
